## Install
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To install the app, you will need to have the following installed:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying ```app/page.tsx```. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [```next/font```](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## 💕 Thanks
This project is almost completed like apartment management. However developed by the developer team who is still university students and have not enough experiences, this project maybe has some problem. You can visit our deploy website for more experience. Thank you for visiting our project.

I deeply appreciate every member of this team for showing relentless effort for this project.
