## Install
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To install the app, you will need to have the following installed:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying ```app/page.tsx```. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [```next/font```](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## HOW TO BUILD
```bash
# clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ManhHoDinh/HomeLand.git
$ cd HomeLand

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# pull necessary images
$ docker compose pull

# rename .env.example to .env
# you might change some variable if you need to connect to real redis, postgresql or supabase project
$ cp .env.example .env
```

## HOW TO RUN
```bash
# docker compose include redis and postgresql
# if your local machine have redis or postgresql, please turn off all in order to run properly
$ docker compose up -d

# start supabase local
$ npx supabase start

# start nestjs
$ npm run start:dev

# you might need to send HTTP GET to this endpoint to create empty database and S3 storage:
http://localhost:3000/seed/init
```
